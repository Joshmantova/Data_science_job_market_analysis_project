A Data Scientist is critical to the success of this program to analyze the data we collect and provide statistical correlations that will drive future business decisions. Our team must provide visibility into the metadata collected from Amazon’s internal systems, software development tools, developer output metrics, and internal surveys to highlight differences across organizations. These variances will help drive discussions and investigations into areas that present potential bottlenecks or risks to software delivery. Based on the learnings from these investigations, we will identify best practices that can be shared with all levels of the organization to drive continuous improvement. A Data Scientist will complete the feedback cycle for our team, synthesizing the data we collect, providing correlation analysis, and guiding future investigations.As a Data Scientist, your role will be to leverage the past data to make future predictions, thereby helping us mitigate the uncertainty of the future by making predictions of future performance.
