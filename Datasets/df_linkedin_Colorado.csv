We build models that determine what combination is performing the best for each advertiser. Based on that performance we automatically re-balance budget across the best performing combination. Prediction and forecasting: Our advertisers want to know how many people will see their ad and at what price before they finalize their strategy. For one of our ads to be shown, it likely has to participate in up to 3 different auctions. Can we predict with confidence how often we will win those auctions and at what price? How does that vary based on external market demands? Experimental design: How do we measure the impact of any changes we introduce to our optimization models? How do we quantify any tradeoffs those models may introduce (e.g., you pay more for each ad impression, but each impression is more valuable). Causal inference: How do we determine what ads are performing best? What does it mean to have a high performing campaign? (hint: clicks aren't the answer!) What We Care AboutWhat and how you can contribute is what’s important to us. Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with.

We believe that AI-powered systems have the potential to transform our renewable energy future through advanced automation and control, and are looking for a dynamic researcher with a strong technical background to help pursue this goal.Stochastic optimization and sequential decision problems arise in a variety of areas of renewable energy research including power system planning and management, wind farm optimization, battery management, building energy management, and transportation. At the same time, recent advances in AI (and deep RL in particular) suggest that complex decision making can be optimized via a combination of machine learning, modeling and simulation, often with clear advantages over traditional optimization-based methods. However, these ideas are only just starting to be applied to renewable energy systems and thus constitute a promising set of research directions.The successful candidate will collaborate to develop, adapt, improve, and scale cutting edge AI methods to real-world projects in support of NREL and EERE mission and goals. In addition, the candidate will collaborate with NREL staff and researchers, other national labs, and universities on efforts to develop and apply AI at scale to real-world problems in renewable energy research, with specific emphasis on modernization of the nation’s grid, building, and transportation infrastructure and operation to support the 100% renewable energy scenario. In particular, the candidate will participate in a large interdisciplinary effort to establish the foundations of so-called “autonomous energy systems”, in which quasi-independent agents interact to seamlessly integrate and control large numbers of distributed energy resources.Responsibilities IncludeCollaborate with NREL and partner researchers to develop and apply modern AI and stochastic control techniques for use in real-world energy systems. Primary challenges include identification of appropriate application areas, adaptation of methods to these areas, and scaling of methods to solve relevant problems. Key areas of study include the optimal incorporation of existing domain knowledge into AI methods, the development of scalable algorithms for continuous and/or mixed spaces, and development of hybrid methods that combine the best of both AI and classical stochastic optimization.Evaluate and track the state of artificial intelligence and stochastic control research, especially for sequential decision problems in complex real-world spaces.Author, present and assist in the preparation of technical papers, reports and conference proceedings on topics related to modern AI control methods and their application to energy systems. Basic Qualifications Must be a recent PhD graduate within the last three years.Additional QualificationsPreferred QualificationsExpertise in deep reinforcement learning, including fundamental knowledge and core mathematical underpinnings of neural networks, deep understanding of Markov Decision Processes, state-of-the-art learning algorithms, and their application to continuous and/or large state-action spaces.Expertise in stochastic optimal control, including optimization and control with and without uncertainty, dynamic programming, classical control theory, (stochastic) model predictive control, Kalman filters, scenario generation, etc.Experience with game theory, complex systems theory, agent-based learning, and distributed optimization.Strong background in mathematics, statistics, and probability.Strong background in physics and engineering, esp. of power systems, grid-integrated buildings, and/or transportation systems.Strong programming skills, especially experience using deep learning frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow) on high-performance computing/GPU platforms.

We believe that AI-powered systems have the potential to transform our renewable energy future through advanced automation and control, and are looking for a dynamic researcher with a strong technical background to help pursue this goal.Stochastic optimization and sequential decision problems arise in a variety of areas of renewable energy research including power system planning and management, wind farm optimization, battery management, building energy management, and transportation. At the same time, recent advances in AI (and deep RL in particular) suggest that complex decision making can be optimized via a combination of machine learning, modeling and simulation, often with clear advantages over traditional optimization-based methods. However, these ideas are only just starting to be applied to renewable energy systems and thus constitute a promising set of research directions.The successful candidate will collaborate to develop, adapt, improve, and scale cutting edge AI methods to real-world projects in support of NREL and EERE mission and goals. In addition, the candidate will collaborate with NREL staff and researchers, other national labs, and universities on efforts to develop and apply AI at scale to real-world problems in renewable energy research, with specific emphasis on modernization of the nation’s grid, building, and transportation infrastructure and operation to support the 100% renewable energy scenario.
