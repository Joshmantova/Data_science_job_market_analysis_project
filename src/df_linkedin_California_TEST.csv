5,Data Scientist,Alto Neuroscience,"Los Altos, California, United States",Over 200 applicants,"COMPANY INFORMATION - ALTO NEUROSCIENCE - altoneuroscience.com
Alto Neuroscience is a private company headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area. Alto is developing a new generation of neural biomarker-based diagnostic tests and personalized treatments for use in psychiatry, based on a platform built from data aggregated at scale and proprietary artificial intelligence analysis tools. The team combines world-leading neuroscientists and business executives with experience commercializing products for the brain.

There currently is no objective way to diagnose psychiatric illness, nor to identify which treatment is best for an individual patient. Treatment selection is presently done by trial-and-error as there are no reliable blood tests nor objective brain measures, for example, that can inform these decisions. This results in clinical care that is highly inefficient and costly. Alto is focused on addressing this need through finding novel brain biomarkers that can define actionable subtypes of psychiatric illnesses, or inform the development and deployment of new treatments. To that end, we are building a platform capable of identifying a pipeline of new brain-based candidate biomarkers that can underpin new product opportunities.

ROLE SUMMARY - DATA SCIENTIST
Under direct supervision of the chief technology and medical officers, the Data Scientist will complete programming tasks within a developing IT infrastructure surrounding 1) large-scale clinical and biomarker datasets and 2) incoming data from prospective clinical studies. Work will include developing data processing workflows, primarily in python, for the following tasks:

A cloud-based, real-time system for data management, quality control, pre-processing, feature extraction, and machine learning from a multimodal set of brain signals
Automated deidentification and extraction of relevant signals from electronic medical records (EMRs)
Correlating brain signals with clinical information using machine learning
Work closely with Alto’s data science and medical teams to deliver novel diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for brain health

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Build and deploy machine learning models for brain signal-based prediction tasks
Develop visualization tools to interpret results
Daily responsibilities will include algorithmic design and implementation, data analysis, coding/debugging, troubleshooting, and health monitoring/alerting

QUALIFICATIONS AND EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS
Degree in Computer Science, Information Systems Management, Engineering, or other quantitative fields
2+ years of Python programming/development experience
1+ years of machine learning experience
Be a team player while being able to work independently
Share a desire to improve mental healthcare delivery
Coding experience in linux/CentOS environment
Deep understanding of predictive modeling, machine-learning, clustering and classification techniques, and algorithms
Fluency in a programming language (Python, C,C++, Java, SQL)
Good to have: Cloud development experience, MATLAB, and EEG data analysis experience

If interested, please email info@altoneuroscience.com with your CV and answers to the following questions:
1) Why you want to work at Alto

2) What unique skill you could bring to Alto to help us in our efforts to improve mental health through the development of brain biomarkers and machine learning

3) What do you consider as one or two of the most overlooked or undervalued analysis techniques for EEG in psychiatry and why?

4) What resources do you feel could have significantly helped in your previous position or analysis and why (pick one or two)

5) What are the top two things that you are looking for in your next role and what do you expect from Alto were we to offer you the position."

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
