6,Data Science Intern,The Trade Desk,"Boulder, CO, US",Over 200 applicants,"Who We Are

The Trade Desk is a global technology company with a mission to build a better Internet for everyone through principled, intelligent advertising. Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100X the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.

About The Team

The Data Science team is responsible for transforming the data we generate off of our 600 billion queries per day into actionable intelligence using advanced modelling and optimization algorithms. Our mission is to develop new and powerful means of growing the value of our clients’ campaigns across millions of web-based publishers.

AS A DATA SCIENCE INTERN AT THE TRADE DESK, YOU WILL:

Have the opportunity to contribute in the development of new and existing data products, experiencing firsthand the day-to-day life of a professional data scientist. In addition to close mentorship from members of our team, you will also interact closely with our product, trading, and engineering teams to oversee the implementation of your projects. Our hope is to see all of our interns’ ideas and research contribute directly to our client facing product.

You might be a great fit for a Data Science internship at if:
You are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies, machine learning techniques, and advancements in the AdTech industry
You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity
You have a deep understanding of statistical machine learning and optimization techniques as well
You want to work with big data technologies such as Hadoop, Hive, Spark, AWS
You have experience in at least one programming languages (Python, R, Java, Scala, etc.) and are comfortable with SQL by the start of the internship
You are able to deliver a convincing story derived from the data sets to both a technical and non-technical audiences


Our Team Is Working On
Optimization: Ad campaigns are often combinations of lots of different types of ads -- different images/messages are shown on different web pages (or apps), to different kinds of people. We build models that determine what combination is performing the best for each advertiser. Based on that performance we automatically re-balance budget across the best performing combination.
Prediction and forecasting: Our advertisers want to know how many people will see their ad and at what price before they finalize their strategy. For one of our ads to be shown, it likely has to participate in up to 3 different auctions. Can we predict with confidence how often we will win those auctions and at what price? How does that vary based on external market demands?
Experimental design: How do we measure the impact of any changes we introduce to our optimization models? How do we quantify any tradeoffs those models may introduce (e.g., you pay more for each ad impression, but each impression is more valuable).
Causal inference: How do we determine what ads are performing best? What does it mean to have a high performing campaign? (hint: clicks aren't the answer!)


What We Care About

What and how you can contribute is what’s important to us. Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with. We care about having good people to pitch in. Our culture is creative, energetic, and collaborative. Those aren’t perks – those are just the way we do business.

Does this sound like you? If so, we welcome your application and the chance to meet you!

Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk.

Data Center Systems builds world-class controls software, enabling high security metering, monitoring, alarming, and software enabled backstops to ensure the health of our thermal and electrical infrastructure at high infrastructure utilization.

As a Data Scientist, you will work on our Science team and partner closely with other data scientists and DEs on the team as well as Business Intelligence, Technical Program Management, and Software teams to correctly model and optimize our power infrastructure.

You do whatever it takes to add value. You don’t care whether you’re building complex ML models, writing blazing fast code, integrating multiple disparate data-sets, or creating baseline models - you care passionately about shareholders and know that as a curator of data insight you can unlock massive cost savings.

You have a limitless curiosity. You constantly ask questions about the technologies and approaches we are taking and are constantly learning about industry best practices you can bring to our team.
You have excellent business and communication skills to be able to work with product owners to understand key business questions and earn the trust of senior leaders. You will need to learn Data Center architecture and components of electrical engineering to build your models.
